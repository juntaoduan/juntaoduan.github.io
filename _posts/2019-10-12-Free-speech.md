If westerner have free mind, then ads would not make sense to exist since ads are constantly intruding our mind and make money by constructing illusion in our head. Do you upgrade your electronics because you need to? Do you visit Disney world because you need to?

Is there free speech? The moment your mind is influenced by ads, you could not have free speech by your own, because you speak with well designed words influenced by ads. Then how can there be free press?

“Free mind” is just a fake product that capitalists sell together with free press, free speech. Unfortunately it is free, and you should not expect good quality from it.
