Taleb has some interesting ideas I strongly agree but I am definitely not a fun of his books which usually lack simplicity and clarity. One concern he raised is about concentration of business.

The classical wisdom of concentration or mass production is that it reduces cost and produces efficient operation of business. However, is that really good for the whole society? My life experience in China and the U.S. has a clear answer to this. General public can only prosper if there are a lot of small businesses.

Industries in China are far more competitive than in U.S. because there are so many small business spread out the whole country.
